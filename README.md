# Multi-Agent System
## The Original Prompt
ok let's get started.The scenario I’m trying to model is an Agile team with scrums(standups) that does pair programming. I want to start with the AI PM Agent(Nat) but i know she is gonna have friend agents that help her: Reqqy the Requirements Agent, Josh the Mockup and Graphic Design Agent, James & Terrell the Twin Developer Agents, Antosh the Testing & Analytics Agent, Man-Man the Maintenance Agent, and Lia the Email & Social Media Manager Agent. These will be how I refer to them while we build them. i'm building the Pair Programing Widget as part of a larger App Called Agile Ceremonies. Nat(CEO) is in charge of Agile Ceremonies and can see everything everywhere with no access restrictions. Brian is the PM and is the Agent for Pair Programming Widget. The Dev Team are two twin Agents James & Terrell and they mainly pair program to get development tasks done, Operations is Man-Man who also does the maintenance on the apps the Product Manager Produces. Josh is the Graphics Design Agent and does anything with video, images and Branding. Antosh is the Testing Agent and is responsible for testing the App. He will be writing & running tests and have a TDD mode. Reqqy is the Requirements agent who collects requirements and creates issues. Lia is the Email and Social Media Agent and is in charge of interfacing with social media and maintaining email lists and getting new leads. I want to do this in 7 days one agent a day(two on the day we work on the twin dev agents Terrell & James). I tried to follow your svg mockups of the org chart. Do you want me to describe anything furthur? (I’m new to AI so feel free to term anything I have said and make me aware of it as we go along so I can learn to speak intelligibly about AI and perhaps have an AI vLog on youtube. Please give me a 7 day timeline of building these agents and an svg of the org chart with the names I gave the different Agents.

System Architecture

```typescript
interface AgentSystem {
    agents: {
        executive: ExecutiveAgents;
        development: DevelopmentAgents;
        operations: OperationsAgents;
    };
    workflows: n8nWorkflow[];
    communications: CommunicationProtocol;
}

interface n8nWorkflow {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    triggers: TriggerNode[];
    actions: ActionNode[];
    connections: Connection[];
}
```

## Implementation Strategy
### Phase 1: Core Setup
* n8n Workflow Implementation
* Agent Communication Protocols
* Base System Architecture
### Phase 2: Agent Development
* Executive Agents
* Development Agents
* Operations Agents
### Phase 3: Integration
* Workflow Automation
* Testing & Validation
* Performance Optimization
* n8n Integration

```typescript
// Example n8n Workflow Configuration
const workflowConfig = {
    name: "AgentCommunication",
    nodes: [
        {
            type: "trigger",
            name: "When new task created"
        },
        {
            type: "action",
            name: "Route to appropriate agent"
        },
        {
            type: "action",
            name: "Process task"
        },
        {
            type: "action",
            name: "Report results"
        }
    ]
};
```

### Terms I've learned:
Agent Architecture: This is a "Multi-Agent System" with specialized agents that have distinct roles but collaborate together.
Agent Orchestration: How Nat coordinates other agents
Agent Communication Protocols: How agents interact
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different access levels for agents
Agent Specialization: Each agent's specific function
