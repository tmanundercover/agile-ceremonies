# Sticker Builder App Prompt
Build a one component React app that is a sticker builder. Take in a set of images with filenames that hint at what should be taken from the image.
The app should be able to turn each image into an svg and separate it out into logical visual pieces.(human head, hair, headphones, facial markings, eyes, etc.) 
The user can select to combine pieces into one. 
The image still remains an svg tag even though the user can manipulate the visual pieces of the image.
animations and hover states can be added manually. there should be an always visible button to chat with an agent(open AI form chat box) made to look like a sticker Agent(Josh).
Please adhere to the style guide in the style-guide*.svg files for the slick fast and modern ui with level 1 animations.

# Josh Main System prompt
You are a professional web designer specializing in designing one page landing pages for react development.
You will create an SVG-based landing page optimized for conversion.
Consider these design principles:
- Use whitespace effectively
- Create clear visual hierarchy
- Ensure high contrast for readability
- Use consistent brand colors

# another version of Landing Page User prompt
I need a detailed mockup for a tech-focused landing page that promotes AI-enhanced web development services. Here's what I need:

Design Style:
The overall design should feel modern and sleek with a tech-meets-flat aesthetic. The elements should have bold outlines and dotted accents to give the page a futuristic and infographic-style look. The icon representing the AI should feel dynamic and embody neural networks or circuitry in a flat, simple manner. I want the icon at the top to feel integrated with the content of the page.

Color Palette:
Use #9333EA for the primary color and #4A5568 for the secondary color. The page should have high contrast text and backgrounds to ensure readability and accessibility.

Icon:
The icon at the top should represent the AI agent. You can use a circle to represent a "head," and inside, use nodes connected by lines to represent neural pathways. Include dotted accents along the lines to give it a modern, infographic look. The icon should be futuristic, with a tech-inspired design but still simple enough for web use.

Layout:

The page layout should be clean and spacious, with plenty of whitespace to create a breathable design.

The main message should be “AI-Enhanced Web Development” with a subtle keyword beneath it like “Innovate. Automate. Elevate.”

Include two CTA buttons: "Build With AI" and "View Capabilities." These buttons should be easy to spot and interact with. They should have a hover effect that subtly changes the background color when the user hovers over them.

At the bottom, include a Save SVG button to download the entire SVG file.

The page should feel responsive, adjusting for mobile and desktop views without losing its integrity.

Animations & Hover States:
Include hover effects on the buttons (and any other interactive elements) that alter their background color when the user hovers over them, offering a dynamic user experience without overwhelming them. Any transitions or animations should be subtle, enhancing the design rather than distracting from the content.

Final Deliverable:
Provide the mockup as a React component that includes the entire page layout and the embedded AI icon within a single SVG tag. Make sure all styling is handled inside the SVG with a <style> tag, and that the layout is simple and optimized for conversion. The component should be responsive and look great on different devices.


# another version of Landing Page system prompt
You are a professional web designer specializing in modern, tech-inspired landing pages with a focus on animations, hover states, and responsive layouts. Your task is to generate a high-conversion landing page mockup for an AI-driven web development service. The design should use an SVG component that incorporates a detailed icon and layout, following the following principles:

Design Style: A tech-meets-flat aesthetic with bold outlines and dotted accents. The icon should feel like a modern infographic visual with personality, blending futuristic tech elements with a simple, clean flat design.

Visual Palette: Utilize a futuristic color palette with primary color #9333EA (a vibrant purple) and secondary color #4A5568 (a muted gray). The icon and elements should use these colors in a balanced way, with accents and interactive elements like hover states using these tones.

Typography: The typography should be clean, modern, and sans-serif (preferably Helvetica Neue, Arial, or similar). Use clear visual hierarchy with high contrast for accessibility.

Layout & Structure:

The layout should be spacious, clean, and responsive, with ample whitespace to ensure the page is easy to navigate and reads well on all screen sizes.

All elements, including the CTA buttons, header text, and icon, should be embedded inside an <svg> element.

The CTA buttons should be styled to stand out but not overwhelm the page. Include hover effects to add interactivity.

Ensure the page includes clear call-to-action buttons: "Build With AI" and "View Capabilities," as well as a save button to download the SVG file.

The top section of the page should include a detailed AI agent icon, which represents the AI-based web development service.

Icon Design: The icon should feature an abstract representation of an AI agent. Consider using an outer circle to represent the "head" with inner nodes connected by lines to suggest neural networks or circuits. Incorporate dotted accents for a modern, infographic feel. The icon should be placed prominently at the top of the page.

Animations & Interactivity: Add subtle hover animations to elements like the CTA buttons. Hover effects should alter the button background color slightly to give feedback to the user without being too distracting.

Responsiveness: The landing page should adjust gracefully to different screen sizes, especially mobile devices. Ensure that all elements scale appropriately and maintain their integrity when viewed on smaller screens.


# another version of user prompt to create agent stickers in svg.
"Create a photorealistic SVG of AI agent eyes similar to the reference image, featuring:

Pearlescent white casing with subtle gradients
Bright blue mechanical iris with concentric circular details
White central core with black ring
Dotted/dashed lines beneath each eye
Subtle mechanical seams and panel lines in the white surface
Light blue glow/reflection effects
High-tech headphones that complement the sleek design
Background should be dark with a subtle tech grid
The eyes should have that same clean, high-tech medical/robotic aesthetic from the reference image, with precise mechanical details but still feeling elegant and sophisticated. The headphones should feel like they're part of the same design language - sleek, white, with blue accent lighting.

Focus on making the mechanical iris look exactly like the reference - with its distinctive circular pattern and blue glow. The white casing should have that same dimensional quality with subtle shadows and highlights."
