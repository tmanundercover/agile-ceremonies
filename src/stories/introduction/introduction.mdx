  ## Welcome to Agile Ceremonies

  The Multi-Agent System is a comprehensive platform designed to model an Agile team with standups and pair programming capabilities. This intelligent ecosystem consists of multiple specialized AI agents working together to handle different aspects of the software development lifecycle.

  Our system represents a new paradigm in software development assistance, where each agent has defined responsibilities and expertise, yet collaborates seamlessly with other agents to achieve project goals.

  ## Meet the Agents

  Each agent in our system has been carefully designed to fulfill specific roles in the software development process. Together, they form a complete team capable of taking projects from requirements to deployment.
