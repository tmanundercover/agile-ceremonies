## My Action Figure Collection

High-quality toy-like photo of a sealed plastic blister pack on cardboard. Inside, a fit African American action figure titled “The Handsomest Nerd” stands confidently. With short hair, a confident smirk, he dons a nerdy yet stylish outfit: crisp suspenders, a patterned bow tie/collar, a neat button-down, and glasses. Three accessories—a futuristic laptop, a small friendly robot, and a sleek AI-themed device—accompany him. The packaging sports an AI vibe with a crimson-to-cream gradient background, bold letters naming “The Handsomest Nerd” with the subtitle “ACTION FIGURE.” The scene is minimal, playful, and lit with smooth, diffused light that mimics polished plastic, as if on display.
