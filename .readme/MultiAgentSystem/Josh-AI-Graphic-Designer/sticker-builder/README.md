# Prompt
Build a one component React app that is a sticker builder. Take in a set of images with filenames that hint at what should be taken from the image.
The app should be able to turn each image into an svg and separate it out into logical visual pieces.(human head, hair, headphones, facial markings, eyes, etc.) 
The user can select to combine pieces into one. 
The image still remains an svg tag even though the user can manipulate the visual pieces of the image.
animations and hover states can be added manually. there should be an always visible button to chat with an agent(open AI form chat box) made to look like a sticker Agent(Josh).
Please adhere to the style guide in the style-guide*.svg files for the slick fast and modern ui with level 1 animations.
