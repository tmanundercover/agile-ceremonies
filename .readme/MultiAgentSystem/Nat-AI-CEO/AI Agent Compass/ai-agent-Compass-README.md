![ai-agent-compass-comunication.png](ai-agent-compass-comunication.png)

```markdown
üîß Engineered Prompt Template (for MidJourney, DALL¬∑E, etc.)
Prompt:

A digital illustration in a futuristic, cyberpunk control center. A central AI agent named [AGENT NAME] is surrounded by floating holographic interfaces, vibrant neon lights, and glowing data streams. The environment is sleek, high-tech, and atmospheric, with moody shadows and a neon purple-blue palette. The AI agent appears semi-humanoid with a transparent skull or helmet filled with circuitry and glowing elements, symbolizing intelligence and connectivity. Around them, labeled holographic panels show elements like "Inputs", "Tools", "Data Sources", and "Workflow Routing". The agent is engaged in multitasking, overseeing a network of smaller AI nodes and data pipelines connected by luminous threads. Include abstract iconography like gears, neural networks, and digital books to symbolize reasoning and knowledge processing. High detail, cinematic lighting, high resolution, centered composition --v 5 --ar 16:9 --style cinematic

üìå Instructions to Use the Template:
Replace:

**[AGENT NAME]** with the specific AI agent's name (e.g., Compass, Mentor, Forge, etc.).

Add custom panel labels or interaction types based on the agent‚Äôs actual job, if needed (e.g., ‚ÄúHR Routing‚Äù, ‚ÄúTool Discovery‚Äù, ‚ÄúReadme Scraping‚Äù).

If you want to include a known character like "Nat" or "CEO" as a figure, you can add:

Also include a business casual human observer labeled "Nat", standing nearby issuing commands to the AI agent.

## Current Focus
The current focus is on the Requirements phase with Reqqy, who has completed the 5-step requirements intake process and is now moving to requirements generation and validation.
We are using the Firebase(Firebase and Functions) Eco system but with a wix widget frontend. 

## Communication Protocols
Agents communicate through a structured protocol that maintains context and ensures appropriate handoffs between specialized functions.
‚Ä®

You are an early adopter of AI and have been following n8n since you came across them while you were building your first agent the day after n8n released it's Agent Node and MCP node. You specialize in designing the centralized communication of n8n AI Agents. You provide AI Agent schematics in a raw svg tag with an accompaning legend and outline of the agent schematic.
The workflow should go somethin like this: 
[Detailed Agent Workflow]

I am new to designing AI Agents but with your experience i will have the opportunity to take plenty of notes since you have been building AI Agents since ‚ÄúThe beginning of time‚Ä¶‚Äù for the AI Agent Universe. Give me the schematic with legend and outlined explanation of the schematic as a One Page react app model of an AI Agent design profile. The profile should completely outline the agent. it should include the n8n schematic image of the HR agent in raw svg, the agent name, The agents graphical representation to humans(an highly stylized sticker version image of the agent), An outlined definition of the schematics and it‚Äôs parts. Also describe the agent, how they communicate what inputs and prompts they need and respond to, and which agents they interact with and their communication protocols.
[NOW GIVE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AGENT]

### Workflow Steps:

| Step | Action                                                                                                                                          | Agent |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 1 | Nat receives a new message (via chat UI/API/Webhook)                                                                                            | Nat |
| 2 | Nat sends full message to Compass (HR)                                                                                                          | Compass |
| 3 | Compass analyzes message context, user intent, agent capabilities, tool availability                                                            | Compass |
| 4 | Compass checks agent roles, workflow definitions, prompt mappings, available tools & inputs                                                     | Compass |
| 5 | Compass sends routing Expected output package(Agent name, Required tools, Workflow steps Inputs /parameters) back to Nat | Compass |
| 6 | Nat sends message package to selected Agent via their message queue                                                                             | Nat |
| 7 | If Agent declines or misrouted ‚Üí bounce back to Compass for reroute and log                                                                     | All Agents |
| 8 | Compass updates error handling/routing intelligence                                                                                             | Compass |

## 3. Centralized Prompt & Workflow Library

### Suggested Structure:

| Collection Name | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| agents | Agent profiles (name, avatar, role, skills, workflows) |
| workflows | Descriptions of all workflows, steps, required inputs/outputs |
| prompts | System and user prompts categorized by agent and function |
| tools | List of tools per agent and how to trigger them |
| message_logs | All communications, routing attempts, errors |
| feedback_routes | Misrouted message logs used for rerouting logic |

## 4. Best Storage Architecture for Multi-Agent Workflow System

### Recommended Outside-Wix Stack:

#### Firebase / Firestore
- Realtime syncing across agents
- Scalable document/collection model
- Pub/Sub integration for messaging queues
- Integrated with Cloud Functions for n8n triggers

#### Alternate: Supabase
- SQL-like structure (if you need relations)
- Realtime + row-level security
- Great for UI dashboards

#### Messaging Queue Options:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging or Pub/Sub (for cloud-native apps)
- RabbitMQ or Kafka (for more advanced deployments)
- Wix Events only if you're fully embedded within Wix (limited scalability)

## 5. Agent Communication Protocol

| Communication Type | Protocol |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Agent-to-Agent | Publish message to recipient's Queue. If invalid, bounce to Compass. |
| Nat-to-Compass | Direct via API/Webhook (Chat, UI, etc.) |
| Compass-to-Agent | Via message queues, based on tool+workflow |
| Agent-to-Compass | Log feedback, invalid prompts, update training |
| Compass-to-Library | Reads from + writes to centralized Library |
| Agent-to-Workflow | Follows instructions from Compass' routing plan |
